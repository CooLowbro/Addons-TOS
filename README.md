###Good Bye Isabela

Original name: Check Skillshop

Original addon: https://github.com/chicori/TOS-Addon

Translated version: 1.0.1

This addon has 3 modes. Basicaly it will control how you buy buffs from pardoners.

I made some modifications to be fiatable for ITOS.

####1st mode: OFF (Default)
- You cant another buff while you have one active.
- You cant buy overpriced buffs (over 5000 silver)

####2nd mode: ON
- Ask you if you want to cancel the active buff and buy a new one.
- Warn you when you are buying an overpriced buff.

####3rd mode: SELF (Default)
- Offer you to cancel the active buff upon trying a new one. (But dont buy)
- Warn you when you are buying an overpriced buff.
